# Trading Wheels

**What is Trading Wheels?**
Trading Wheels is an online game for making wild bets on the stock market without spending your own sweet money.

**Objective of the Game:**
Get the highest return on your investment

## How it works
1. Each participant receives $5000 in fake game money to invest in stocks every week.

2. The participant can “buy” stocks by filling out a form (sent via email to partipants) with the ticker (stock symbol: example AAPL for Apple) and quantity of the stocks they wish to buy.

3. Competition begins Monday and winners are determined on Friday. The participant with the highest “return” is the winner of the week. Return = profit earned on the $5000 investment. For example, if you end with $5021 on your portfolio at the end of the week, $21 is your return.
